# Social Anxiety Learning Support Tool


## Overview
This project is inspired by my younger sister, **Miray**, who experiences severe social anxiety, making it difficult for her to communicate with others, including teachers, especially in online settings. The goal of this software is to provide a **supportive, stress-free learning environment** that allows individuals like Miray to continue their studies without the pressure of direct social interaction.

Since she has a passion for learning new languages, this tool also integrates features that encourage her interests while helping her build confidence in a comfortable space.

## Features
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Provides structured courses and lessons tailored to different subjects.
- **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech**: Allows users to communicate through writing or speech synthesis.
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Offers real-time feedback and guidance without requiring direct human interaction.
- **Customizable Experience**: Users can tailor the interface and learning pace to suit their comfort level.
- **Gamified Elements**: Encourages engagement through achievements and rewards.

## Why This Matters
For individuals with social anxiety, traditional learning methods can be overwhelming. This tool aims to **remove barriers to education** by offering a safe space where users can learn and express themselves at their own pace.

## How It Works
1. Users select a subject or language they want to learn.
2. Lessons are presented in an interactive, low-pressure format.
3. AI-generated responses and speech-to-text tools help bridge communication gaps.
4. Users can track progress and gain confidence over time.

## Future Plans
- Expanding language learning features with conversational AI.
- Adding a supportive online community for users to share experiences.
- Implementing adaptive learning algorithms to personalize the experience.
