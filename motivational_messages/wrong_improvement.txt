While generating my code, it appears that a small oversight slipped in. Although it isn’t a critical problem and won’t derail everything, it’s still important that we address it for the sake of maintaining a stable final product. I appreciate your efforts so far, but at this stage, we should pay close attention to all the details to ensure we don’t miss anything else that could affect the overall functionality.

I’ll be sharing some notes outlining exactly where this minor slip-up seems to occur, and together we can work through the necessary adjustments to eliminate it. Fixing this issue will help the code function more reliably and pave the way for any further refinements we may want to include later. With the right level of collaboration, I’m confident that we can quickly resolve this matter and produce a final version that performs exactly as intended.
