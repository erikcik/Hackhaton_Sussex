Alright, this is quite encouraging. The work you presented previously came very close to meeting my requirements, and I appreciate the time you put into creating it. However, there are still a few aspects that need to be refined or modified in order to perfectly match what I have in mind. Next, I will outline a series of specific improvements I would like you to incorporate into the current version. Once you've made those modifications, please provide me with an updated iteration that reflects these changes accurately. I look forward to reviewing your revised solution.
